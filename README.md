# Is it probable that guidance will be missed if current trends continue?
### 2024 Guidence:
* Revenue: 570 - 610m
* EBITDA: 45 - 52m

### H1 2024 EBITDA Margin is 8.2 % and Revenue is 292.737m
* EBITDA H1 2024 was 23.9m

# âš¡ For the detailed analyis check the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/rasvob/Duratec-Segments-Report/blob/main/segments_analysis.ipynb)

#### ðŸ“Œ TLDR: Given the high revenue growth and current EBITDA of 8.2 % it is improbable in current conditions to miss the estimates as they are pretty reasonable

### Order book and Tenders are important for further Revenue/EBITDA growth
* Order book is more volatile in nature
* The most important thing is that Tenders are growing as if the win rate is maintained/higher than now, the order book will follow

#### ðŸ’¡ If they want to miss EBITDA they would have to either:
1) Have EBITDA margin lower than 5.7 %
2) Lower Revenue CAGR in each segment by 7-9 % and have EBITDA margin lower than 6.2 %
